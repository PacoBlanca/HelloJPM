Project name: HelloJPMorgan

Purpose: Work, get a job, have fun

Spec: Weak
-----------------
Done: Java 8 application, JavaFX

How to run: Double click on HelloJPMorgan.jar or in command line you can execute for example with: java -jar HelloJPMorgan.jar

Comments: Run every place on Windows, Linux, Mac, etc. Between the binaries you have a .html to run it in a browser. On Linux get the right permissions to execute. On browser review conf. to allow JVM and Java 8 jre in your explorer. 2-way output, that is, standard output and window-based. The paradigm here was "Super Simple", but sometimes I want to have some fun, so the JavaFX idea was to make only 1 file of code and doing nothing get a desktop/command line/web app, and more.
